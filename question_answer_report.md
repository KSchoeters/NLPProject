Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. They consume organic material, breathe oxygen, and are capable of voluntary movement. Animals can be defined as any members of the kingdom Animalia, comprising multicellular organisms that have a well-defined shape and usually limited growth.

According to Merriam-Webster, animals are "any of a kingdom (Animalia) of living things including many-celled organisms and often many of the single-celled ones (such as protozoans)". The Cambridge English Dictionary defines animals as "something that lives and moves but is not a human, bird, fish, or insect". 

Animals can range from simple organisms like sponges to complex organisms like humans. They can be found in various environments, including land, water, and air. Animals play a crucial role in the ecosystem, serving as both predators and prey, and contributing to the balance of nature.
