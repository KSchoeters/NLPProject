Animals are multicellular eukaryotes whose cells are bound together by collagen, with sperm and forming polar bodies in oogenesis. The modern taxonomy includes five kingdoms: Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Monera, and Protista, with further subdivisions to categorize all known life. The primary method of animal classification is through the use of nine branching categories: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Suborder, Family, Genus, and Species.

There are six main animal groups: invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Each type exhibits unique evolutionary adaptations. Invertebrates make up at least 95 percent of all animal species, while the remaining animals are vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone.

Recent progress in the field of animal phylogeny has important implications for understanding the evolution of development, morphology, genomes, and cells. A phylogeny, or a phylogenetic tree, is a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships among species. The study of phylogeny aims to determine the evolutionary relationships between phyla. Currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into several distinct phyla based on body plans and other morphological features.

Studying animal phylogeny helps us understand how different species evolved over time, how they are related, and how they adapt to their environments. It also has implications for the conservation and management of biodiversity, as well as for biotechnology and the development of new treatments for diseases.
